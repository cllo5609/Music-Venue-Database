# Music-Venue-Database
Outline:
Prestige Worldwide Entertainment is the owner and operator of nine live performance venues located in major cities across the United States with sights set on expanding internationally. Each venue features between one and three separate rooms, where different artists can be performing simultaneously. Between all venues, PWE puts on 400 events annually.
 
The concert schedule for all the venues is maintained using a single backend database. Employees from each venue can use a web application to select, insert, update and delete artist information from the database. The database holds the date of the event, the venue where the performance will be held, the room/stage within that venue, the band/group that is playing, instruments that a band/group will require from the venue, information about the tickets for the performance and information about the customer that purchased tickets.
